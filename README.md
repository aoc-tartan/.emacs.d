# A reasonable Emacs config

This config is based on Steve Purcell's config.

Emacs itself comes with support for many programming languages. This
config adds improved defaults and extended support for the following:

* Ruby / Ruby on Rails
* CSS / LESS / SASS / SCSS
* HAML / Markdown / Textile / ERB
* Clojure (with Cider and nRepl)
* Javascript / Coffeescript
* Python
* PHP
* Haskell
* Elm
* Erlang
* Common Lisp (with Slime)

In particular, there's a nice config for *autocompletion* with
[company](https://company-mode.github.io/), and
[flycheck](http://www.flycheck.org) is used to immediately highlight
syntax errors in Ruby, Python, Javascript, Haskell and a number of
other languages.

## Supported Emacs versions

The config should run on Emacs 24.1 or greater and is designed to
degrade smoothly - see the Travis build - but note that Emacs 24 and
above is required for an increasing number of key packages, including
`magit`, `company` and `flycheck`, so to get full you should use the
latest Emacs version available to you.

Some Windows users might need to follow
[these instructions](http://xn--9dbdkw.se/diary/how_to_enable_GnuTLS_for_Emacs_24_on_Windows/index.en.html)
to get TLS (ie. SSL) support included in their Emacs.

## Other requirements

To make the most of the programming language-specific support in this
config, further programs will likely be required, particularly those
that [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) uses to provide
on-the-fly syntax checking.

## Changing themes and adding your own customization

To add your own customization, use <kbd>M-x customize</kbd>, <kbd>M-x
customize-themes</kbd> etc. and/or create a file
`~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-local.el` which looks like this:

```el
... your code here ...

(provide 'init-local)
```

If you need initialisation code which executes earlier in the startup process,
you can also create an `~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-preload-local.el` file.

If you plan to customize things more extensively, you should probably
just fork the repo and hack away at the config to make it your own!
Remember to regularly merge in changes from this repo, so that your
config remains compatible with the latest package and Emacs versions.

*Please note that I cannot provide support for customised versions of
this configuration.*
